# unit-converter
One of my first challenges at BCW, the goal was to create a unit conversion Web application that could convert U.S. standard measurements to metric and vice-versa.

I believe the skills we were supposed to walk away with from this project was writing pure code and using a correct order of operations with parens.

Learning how to set an ActiveView value when using Angularn ng-show was a pretty cool way to update the view even though I hadn't learned how to use $stateProvider and component-based angular.

The level of complextity in each controller would increase further down the conversions that i had. And although most people struggled with the very last question, I found the body mass index calculator to be more challenging than the very last question that happened to be the loan calculator.
